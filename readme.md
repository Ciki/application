Nette Application MVC
=====================

Model-View-Controller is a software architecture that was created to satisfy the need to separate utility code (controller) from application logic code (model) and from code for displaying data (view) in applications with graphical user interface. With this approach we make the application better understandable, simplify future development and enable testing each unit of the application separately.

Please, [see documentation](https://doc.nette.org/en/presenters).

It requires PHP version 5.6 and supports PHP up to 8.0.
